restful-booker-platform assessment

The automation framework for the Restful-booker-platform project has been built using CucumberJVM (Java)
framework. This tool was chosen mainly because it allows the specification to be read as part of the test.
Three different features have been developed to test the functionality of the Hotel App - Login, create an entry and create multiple entries.
Page Object Model concept has been used throughout the framework to group the elements of each page of the application.
